### **Other Things**

1. I'm currently learning about React.JS and Next.JS. And I'm also learning Unity and 3D Modeling.
2. Ask me about participating in valuable projects, but I'm also open to questions about NodeJS, especially with ExpressJS.
3. I have learning in project management using Scrum (as Scrum Master), if you need to organize any project, feel free to ask me.
4. I love fantasy games, as well as a lot of pop culture, including anime and manga, but games make my day happier after a hard day of coding. :)
